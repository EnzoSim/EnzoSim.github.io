# Centered Personal Portfolio Design Guide

## About This Design

Your website is styled after [gregoiremaillard.com](https://gregoiremaillard.com/) - a clean, centered, personal portfolio that balances professionalism with approachability.

## Design Philosophy

### Personal Yet Professional
This design lets your personality shine while maintaining credibility. It's perfect for young professionals who want to be taken seriously without seeming stuffy.

### Simplicity is Key
No sidebars, no complex navigation, no distractions. Just you, your work, and your interests - all clearly presented.

### Content-First
The centered design naturally draws attention to what matters: your experience, your research, and your passions.

## Key Design Elements

### Layout
- **Centered alignment** - Everything centered for modern, clean look
- **Single column** - Easy to read, natural flow
- **Generous spacing** - Lots of whitespace for breathing room
- **Max width: 600px** - Optimal reading width

### Typography
- **Large heading** - Your name at 2.5rem
- **Readable body text** - 1rem with 1.6 line height
- **Clean hierarchy** - Size and weight create structure
- **System fonts** - Fast loading, native appearance

### Color Palette
- **Text**: #333 (dark gray) for body, #222 for headings
- **Links**: #0066cc (friendly blue)
- **Borders**: #e0e0e0 (light gray)
- **Background**: White

### Profile Photo
- **Large and prominent** - 200px circular
- **First thing visitors see** - Makes personal connection
- **Professional but friendly** - Sets the tone

### Interest Cards
Three interactive cards that link to detailed sections:
- Hover effect draws attention
- Clear icons (üìö üî¨ üöÄ) add personality
- Each leads to more detailed content

## What Makes It Work

### 1. Approachable
The centered design and personal tone make you seem accessible and easy to work with - important for young professionals.

### 2. Clear
No confusing navigation. Visitors immediately see who you are, what you do, and what interests you.

### 3. Modern
This style is contemporary and will age well. It focuses on content, not design trends.

### 4. Fast
Minimal CSS, no heavy JavaScript, loads instantly anywhere.

### 5. Personal
Unlike traditional CV sites, this lets your personality and interests shine through.

## Customization Tips

### Make It Yours

1. **Bio section**: Write in first person, show personality
   - Good: "I love analyzing markets..."
   - Not: "Professional with expertise in..."

2. **Interest cards**: Choose topics you're passionate about
   - Reading/learning
   - Research/projects
   - Hobbies/activities
   - Side projects

3. **Tone**: Be professional but natural
   - Write like you're emailing a colleague
   - Don't be too formal or too casual

### Colors
To change the blue link color, edit in styles.css:
```css
a {
    color: #0066cc;  /* Change this */
}
```

### Photo
- Should show your face clearly
- Professional but not stiff
- Good lighting
- Natural expression

## Content Strategy

### Above the Fold (First Screen)
- Your photo
- Your name
- Who you are and where
- Quick links (LinkedIn, Email)

### Main Content
- Brief bio (2-3 sentences)
- Experience summary
- Education summary
- Interest cards

### Below
- Detailed sections for each interest
- Full content revealed on scroll

## Why This Works for You

As an economics consultant:
- **Not too formal**: You're young, approachable
- **Not too casual**: You have serious credentials
- **Shows personality**: Beyond just the CV
- **Modern**: Fits current professional norms
- **Focused**: Highlights what matters

## Maintaining the Aesthetic

### Do:

### Don't:
- Add sidebars or complex navigation
- Over-design with colors/effects
- Make it too long (people won't scroll)

- Add unnecessary sections

## Making Updates

1. **New experience**: Add to the experience list (keep it concise)
2. **New interests**: Add a new interest card
3. **New research**: Update the research section
4. **Reading updates**: Keep the reading list current
