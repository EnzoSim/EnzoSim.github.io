# Minimal Theme Design Guide

## About the Minimal Theme

Your website is styled after the popular [orderedlist/minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) theme for GitHub Pages. This is one of the most widely used themes for academic and professional portfolios due to its clean, readable design.

## Design Philosophy

### Simplicity First
The minimal theme focuses on content over decoration. No flashy animations, bold colors, or complex layouts - just clean, readable text that lets your experience speak for itself.

### Academic Aesthetic
Perfect for researchers, academics, and professionals in technical fields. The design has been battle-tested by thousands of GitHub Pages users.

### Key Design Elements

- Clean, system fonts for maximum readability
- Comfortable line spacing
- Hierarchy established through font sizes and weights

**Layout**
- Fixed sidebar on the left (270px wide)
- Main content area on the right (500px wide)
- White background with subtle gray accents
- Plenty of whitespace for easy reading

**Color Palette**

### 2. Professional
No gimmicks or flashy effects. The simplicity conveys professionalism and lets your credentials shine.

### 3. Responsive
Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The sidebar moves above content on smaller screens.

### 4. Fast
With minimal CSS and no heavy JavaScript, the site loads instantly.

## Maintaining the Aesthetic

To keep the minimal theme's clean look:

1. **Don't over-style**: Resist the urge to add decorative elements
2. **Keep it simple**: Let typography create hierarchy
3. **White space is good**: Don't feel pressure to fill every pixel
4. **Content first**: Focus on what you say, not how it looks
5. **Stay consistent**: Use the existing styling for new content

## Making Updates

When adding new content:
- Use existing heading levels (h2, h3, h4)
- Keep paragraphs concise
- Use lists for multiple items
- Maintain consistent spacing

## Why This Theme Works for You

As an economics consultant and strategist, the minimal theme:
- Conveys professionalism and seriousness

- Won't distract potential employers or collaborators
- Ages well (still looks good years later)
